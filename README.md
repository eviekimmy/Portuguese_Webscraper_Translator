# Portuguese_Webscraper_Translator

A couple years ago I was interested in learning Portuguese. I was inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/lhcvejeAB0E?t=282) to focus on learning the most common words I would be using. However, this differs from person to person, and would need to be specialized to my needs. 

I decided to use [this Brazilian lifestyle magazine](https://claudia.abril.com.br) as an excercise for creating my personalized list of most common words. The script I developed 

1. Scrapes text from the top articles on the front page,
2. Ranks them from most to least frequent, and 
4. Saves to csv with an English translation.
